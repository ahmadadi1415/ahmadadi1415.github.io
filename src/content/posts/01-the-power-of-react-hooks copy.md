## üëã Hello 
My name is Ahmad Adi Prasetyo. You can call me Adi. I have had experience in web development for one year using NextJS. Now, I am interested in game development, and I've known and experienced Unity and C# for about a year. Also, I have a hobby of drawing pixel art, and I hope I can use my pixel art to build a game.


## ‚úèÔ∏è Hobby to drawing pixel art
Drawing has already been my hobby since I was a child. But as I get older, I find it difficult to draw anything. That happened when I was in senior high school; there are almost no pictures that I draw with intention, even when I have free time. And when I was in college, I discovered a game called A Space for the Unbound that could produce beautiful pixel art visuals. I didn't know that pixel art could be made like that. That is where I started my pixel art journey. I tried to turn a photo into pixel art for the first time. As time goes on, I learn many things to make my pixel art better and better.


## üéÆ Interested in Game Development
I learned Unity and C# for the first time when I was in my first semester of college. So my game, At Least, is actually my first game I created with Unity, and I assigned it as my college assignment. Then, during my college holiday, I learned about 2D platformer games. Now, I am developing a game for my college assignment in this fifth semester.
